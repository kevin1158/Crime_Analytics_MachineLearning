üîç Key Highlights:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
 - Handling Missing Values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Demographic Analysis: Investigated crime distribution across various demographic groups.
 - Geospatial Analysis: Mapped crime incidents to reveal spatial patterns and city hotspots.
3. Feature Engineering:
 - Data Transformation: Applied techniques such as one-hot encoding.
4. Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling:
 - Regression Analysis: Implemented regression models to identify key predictors of crime and estimate future occurrences.
 - Model Validation: Ensured the robustness and accuracy of our predictions through rigorous validation techniques.

üîß Tools & Technologies:
- Programming Languages and Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning Models: SARIMAX, Prophet, various regression models
- Visualization: Created detailed visualizations to effectively communicate our findings.

üöÄ Impact:
We believe that our analysis not only sheds light on the current state of crime in Los Angeles but also provides predictive insights that can help law enforcement agencies in resource allocation and strategic planning. By understanding when and where crimes are most likely to occur, agencies can take proactive measures to prevent crime, thereby enhancing public safety.
