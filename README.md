# Crime_Analytics_Machine_Learning

 This project was done for the course big data analytics by:
 1) Kevin Roy
 2) Abhishek Varma
 3) Saurabh Shete


 Problem Statement : Predicting whether an area in Los Angeles will experience high or low crime in a given month based on historical data.

 Introduction to the Dataset
 Dataset dimension: 974,477 rows Ã— 28 columns.


Summary

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
 - Handling Missing Values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Demographic Analysis: Investigated crime distribution across various demographic groups.
 - Geospatial Analysis: Mapped crime incidents to reveal spatial patterns and city hotspots.
3. Feature Engineering:
 - Data Transformation: Applied techniques such as one-hot encoding.
4. Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling:
 - Regression Analysis: Implemented classification models to identify key predictors of crime and estimate future occurrences.
 - Model Validation: Validated by using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision , f1 score and confusion matrix.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:
- Programming Languages and Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression(Lasso & Ridge), Random Forest, KNN.
- Visualization: Created detailed visualizations to effectively communicate our findings.

Impact:
- Based on the results, Logistic Regression performs better than other models in terms of accuracy.
- This model can be used by police department for allocating forces as required on monthly basis, thereby increasing public safety.
